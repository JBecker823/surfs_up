1.	Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis. The purpose of this analysis is to examine the weather to present to an investor of the surf and ice cream shop in Hawaii. The investor is concerned about the weather and how it will affect the profits of the company. This analysis uses SQLite database and Jupyter notebook along with Flask to analyze the potential weather impact in Hawaii. 
	
2.	Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
•	The average temperature in Hawaii in June is 75 degrees. The maximum is 85 degrees and the low is 64 degrees.

•	This shows that the temperatures in December vary much more than the temperatures in June. 

3.	Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December. The average temperature between June and December is only a 4-degree difference. This is not much of a difference overall, however, December does come with a risk of being below 65 when that is rare in June. Overall this business would be successful based off of the weather patterns that were analyzed. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another query I would perform would be the average temperature analysis of the area where the most tourists travel from. If many tourists are traveling from cold with an average of 40 degrees in December, the average temperature of 71 would feel very warm and make people want to purchase ice cream. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An additional query that could be beneficial to the investor would be an analysis of the number of tourists in each area that the shops are going to be located at. This can make the difference between a successful business or one that is just getting by.
